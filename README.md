# CelleBright-assignment
I was given a contact information extracted from a mobile phone.

My assignment was to understand the proprietary format of the file and write a short script to get as much information as I can about the contact.

I read the file, and created a PhoneBook that includes all the contact information.

To run, enter file path and the path to save the images for, at run object.

Enjoy
